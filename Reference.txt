Blog Structuring Idea
You could create a series of posts, each dedicated to one category:
- Part 1: Projection & Filtering
- Part 2: Sorting & Joining
- Part 3: Grouping & Aggregation
- Part 4: Quantifiers & Partitioning
- Part 5: Async LINQ in EF Core
- Part 6: Advanced Set Operations
Each post: definition → Chinook example → notes on performance/real-world use.

Would you like me to draft a blog outline with titles + short descriptions for each category post so you have a ready-to-publish series roadmap?

Blog Series Outline: Mastering LINQ with Chinook DB
Part 1: Projection in LINQ – Shaping Your Data
Learn how to transform raw database rows into meaningful shapes. We’ll cover anonymous types, DTOs, and practical projections using Chinook tables like Tracks and Albums.

Part 2: Filtering – Finding the Needle in the Haystack
Dive into Where clauses to filter results. Examples include finding tracks longer than 5 minutes, customers from specific countries, and invoices above a threshold.

Part 3: Sorting – Organizing Results for Clarity
Explore OrderBy and OrderByDescending to sort albums, artists, and invoices. We’ll discuss chaining sorts and how ordering impacts query performance.

Part 4: Joining – Connecting the Dots Across Tables
Master inner joins, group joins, and navigation properties. Examples include linking customers to invoices and albums to artists for richer query results.

Part 5: Grouping & Aggregation – Summarizing Your Data
Learn how to group tracks by genre and calculate aggregates like Count, Sum, and Average. Perfect for building dashboards or reports.

Part 6: Quantifiers – Asking Yes/No Questions of Your Data
Use Any, All, and Contains to check conditions. Examples include verifying if any invoices exceed $100 or if all tracks in an album belong to a genre.

Part 7: Partitioning – Paging Through Data
Understand Take, Skip, and SkipWhile for pagination. We’ll show how to fetch the first 10 customers or implement server-side paging for large datasets.

Part 8: Set Operations – Combining and Comparing Results
Explore Union, Intersect, and Except with real-world Chinook examples, like merging customer lists from different countries or finding unique track sets.

Part 9: Async LINQ with EF Core – Scaling Responsively
Learn how to use ToListAsync, FirstOrDefaultAsync, and SingleAsync for non-blocking queries. We’ll compare sync vs async performance and when to use each.

Part 10: Advanced LINQ Patterns – Beyond the Basics
Wrap up with advanced techniques: nested queries, projections into custom classes, and mixing LINQ with raw SQL for edge cases.
